# Disable Microsoft Safe Links

When enabled, "Microsoft Defender for Office 365" uses a feature called
["Safe Link"][safe-link] to replace links in emails with URLs that go through
Microsoft's servers. I consider this an invasion of my privacy.

The Firefox addon detects when you open a "Safe Link" and, instead of sending
your data to Microsoft, it directly opens the original URL.
